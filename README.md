CCat : The Cauchy Caterpillar - Streaming Erasure Code With Short Memory

ccat.h provides a simple C API for streaming erasure codes with a
fixed window.  This is designed to be used by low-latency netcode.
It generates redundant packets that can fill in for lost originals
in a stream of UDP datagrams.

Example applications:
* VoIP
* Video conferencing/live broadcast
* Live telemetry/statistics feeds

#### Usage:

(1) Call ccat_create() to create a CCatCodec object.

(2) When sending a packet, pass it to ccat_encode_original().

(3) To encode recovery data, call ccat_encode_recovery(), which generates
a packet that can be sent over the network to fill in for losses.

(4) When receiving a packet, pass originals to ccat_decode_original().
Pass encoded data to the ccat_decode_recovery() function.  When recovery
occurs it will call the application's OnRecoveredData() callback.

There is a simple unit test here, which also demonstrates the C++ SDK wrapper:
https://github.com/catid/CauchyCaterpillar/blob/master/tests/Tester.cpp

#### Thread-safety:

Applications can use different locks to protect the ccat_encode_xxx() functions
and the ccat_decode_xxx() functions, because no data is shared between those.
Otherwise the library is not thread-safe.

#### Packet de-duplication:

CCat will not deliver two packets with the same sequence number.

#### Packet re-ordering:

CCat can deliver data out of order.

#### How many FEC packets should be sent?

Based on my simulations you should send at minimum 1.75x the packetloss rate (PLR) or it will not be effective.  I'd recommend just doubling the detected PLR.

The tester generates the minimum "effective packetloss" from a set of 1000 parallel simulations.  The operation hull above is the region in which Cauchy Caterpillar has a minimum effective packetloss of 1% or better.  The script that generated it is in the docs: [gack_generator_js.txt](https://github.com/catid/CauchyCaterpillar/raw/master/docs/gack_generator_js.txt).

What this demonstrates is there's a roughly linear relationship between minimum FEC rate and PLR, with a slope of about 1.75.

#### Limitations and alternatives:

It supports up to 30% redundancy, and so loss rates above about 20% are too high for it to handle.

For a window of 100 milliseconds: The maximum original data stream rate is 2500 packets/second for 1% PLR down to 2000 packets/second for 10% PLR.  This limits the codec to about 2000 packets/second * 1400 bytes/packet = 2.8 Megabytes/second or less.

From the operation hull it's clear there's some non-linear relationship between FEC/PLR/DataRate, but basically it ranges from 2K to 2.5K packets/second before the code starts failing.

For faster streams, using Siamese FEC is recommended:
https://github.com/catid/siamese/

For fountain codes, using Wirehair FEC is recommended:
https://github.com/catid/wirehair/

Compared to Random Linear Codes, the decoding 2+ losses is 2x more likely
(0.2% measured failure rate versus 0.4% for RLC).

Encoding/decoding is a bit faster than RLC thanks to the Cauchy matrix structure.

#### Future work:

The limit on data rate (< 2000 packets/second) and the CPU overhead required can be alleviated by using a more complicated matrix structure like the one I developed for Siamese.

#### Streaming versus Generational Block Codec

There is an older generational block codec that I wrote a while back that you can find here:
https://github.com/catid/shorthair

The advantages of streaming erasure codes over generational block codes are covered here:

#### Credits

I posted about this type of erasure code years ago on my blog, but never finished the project.  Recently Nicolas SAID sent me a paper from Dr. Martin Reisslein that explores a similar idea ( http://mre.faculty.asu.edu/CRLNC.pdf ).  Based on the success of that work I decided to put my own spin on it and release here.  I hope others find it useful!
